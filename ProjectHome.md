The purpose of this project is to create some utilities that can manipulate .dnt files (UC Logic). This format is used by some Genius and Lapazz products. Its description can be found at http://www.lapazz.com/LP-Download/LP-Download.htm Also see http://fightpc.blogspot.com/2006/10/genius-g-note-5000.html for some discussion and perl code.

**Features**:
  * export into svg (combine multiple pages into single html file, future plans)
  * eliminate the need for pressing new page button when writing on a tablet
